Dog walking leash trainer

Author: Reed Searle
Initial Date: 8 March 2022

Problem Statement: Many dogs strain on the end of a leash while being walked.  Although many training techniques exist to counteract this behaviour,
none provide immediate and proportional feedback.

Description:  This project integrates a load cell into a leash to provide proportional measurement of stairn on the leash.  The system takes this input and provide immediate and proportional output via a shock/vibration collar.
